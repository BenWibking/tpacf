*** Fix logic error when auto-correlation is computed with periodic boundaries
    - it appears to add twice as many pairs as it should when doing the periodic
      images.
    - see MultFactor in bins.c!
    - make fix for this less hack-ish
** Fix crash when cross-correlation is computing without any jackknife samples
* Test cross-correlation function with periodic boundary conditions (DONE)
* Add support for (plane-parallel) projected correlation functions
